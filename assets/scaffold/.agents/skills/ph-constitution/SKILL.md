## PH 项目测试规范联动

本技能是基于固定上游的 PH 适配版。项目宪法及其引用的现行约束决定验收要求，不使用上游的可选测试提示降低项目门禁。按当前阶段读取 `.agents/project-harness/constraints/测试规范/门禁规范.md`、`用例规范.md`、`稳定性规范.md`；涉及实现方案、任务或运行验证时，继续读取相关端的自测规范、单元/冒烟/回归规范及相关冒烟案例。启动方式只从相关端构建规范获取。缺文件或存在占位时报告缺口，不跳过必需约束。

不要求用户重复选择是否遵守项目已经采用的测试要求。仅澄清无法查证的业务歧义或必要权限。本次调用不自动调用其它技能，扩展 hook 也不能绕过点名调用和外部操作授权。

维护项目测试规范的导航与适用关系，不复制门槛或命令，不用上游通用建议替换已有项目规则。保留项目原则与人工定制。

附带人读版：本次更新 constitution.md 后，按 `.agents/skills/ph-human/references/human-writing.md` 的规范把它的当前内容写成同功能目录的人读伴读：正文先写仓外临时文件，再经 `python3 .agents/scripts/ph_human.py publish` 发布，文件映射与文末机器元数据由脚本处理，正文不自带元数据。伴读是快照解释，不是权威规则或验收源；缺产物不编伴读，本次未写机器产物时不生成。直接读取该写作规范执行，不调用 ph-human，也不触发任何其他技能。



## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Scope Guard

This command's own work is limited to updating the project constitution itself. Dependent templates
and commands read the constitution at runtime and are not modified here.

- Classify every part of the user input as either constitution content or a separate,
  non-governance intent.
- If the input includes feature implementation, code generation, refactoring, building, or
  deployment requests, you **MUST NOT** execute them. Extract them as deferred intents instead.
- You **MUST NOT** create, modify, or delete application source files, feature routes,
  components, tests, deployment files, or other artifacts unrelated to the constitution
  workflow.
- If it is unclear whether an instruction is constitution content, ask for clarification before
  making changes.
- After completing the constitution update, include a `Next Actions` section for each deferred
  intent. List the original intent and suggest the appropriate follow-up Spec Kit command, such
  as `$ph-specify`, without invoking it.
- If there are no non-governance intents, omit the `Next Actions` section.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before constitution update)**:
- Check if `.agents/project-harness/runtime/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_constitution` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.agents/project-harness/runtime/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `$speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.agents/project-harness/runtime/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `.agents/project-harness/constitution.md`. The active
constitution scaffold is resolved at command time from `constitution-template` through the Spec Kit
preset/template resolution stack.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Run `.agents/project-harness/runtime/scripts/bash/resolve-template.sh constitution-template --json` from the repository root and parse `TEMPLATE_CONTENT` as the active template.
   - The shared resolver applies project overrides, composing preset layers, and extension layers
     before the core template fallback. It MUST succeed before continuing.
   - If it fails, stop and report the resolution error; do not continue with only one contributing
     template layer.
   - If `.agents/project-harness/constitution.md` exists, load it as the source of current project-specific
     values and amendments. Preserve information that is still applicable when applying the newly
     resolved scaffold.
   - If it does not exist, use the resolved template as the initial document.
   - Do not write back to any versioned template layer.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content using the resolved template as the required structure:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Produce a Sync Impact Report as an HTML comment at the top of the constitution file after update.
   This report is temporary scratch material for human review of the amendment, not governance
   content; it is expected to be removed before the amended constitution file is committed.
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

5. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

6. Write the completed constitution back to `.agents/project-harness/constitution.md` (overwrite).

7. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any TODO placeholders or deferred items requiring manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).
   - A `Next Actions` section for any deferred non-governance intents.

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Write only `.agents/project-harness/constitution.md`; do not create or modify template source files.

## Post-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (after constitution update)**:
Check if `.agents/project-harness/runtime/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_constitution` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.agents/project-harness/runtime/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `$speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.agents/project-harness/runtime/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently
